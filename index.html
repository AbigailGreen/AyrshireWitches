                        Jonet Slowane was tried for witchcraft in 1658. She had originally been accused in 1651.
                        She was accused of "malificium" (the act of witchcraft performed with the intention of causing damage or injury) She was also said to be demonic (she probably had a fair temper). She certainly cursed frequently and was quarrelsome.
                        This was over 60 years after James VI had used "witch" hunting as a form of propaganda in his bid for the English crown. "Newes from Scotland" highlighted his battle against the forces of "evil". Surely a man of such integrity and zeal would make an excellent monarch in London!
                        Unfortunately, for poorer folk, there remained the Rev William Adair in Ayr, a man involved in 15 of the 30 trials in the town. Jonet Slowane was one of the last to be tried in the town. Few nobles were ever accused in Scotland and if they were it was probably due to a political motive from the noble (or Royal) born accuser.
                        14 men and 10 women testified against Jonet, tragically one of the accusers was her daughter.
                        She was tried at the Tollbooth in 1659. During her year's incarceration she was found to have the devil's mark on her; this would have involved being stabbed by a 3 inch pin frequently to find an area that didn't discolour when pricked. Torture was perfectly legal for "witch" trials and she would have been deprived of sleep for days which would induce sufficient delirium to implicate others in witchcraft when prompted.
                        She was convicted and sentenced to be strangled and burned. This would have been carried out at the Malt Cross.
                        The reality, this was all probably part of a property dispute.

                    <hr>
                    <p>
                        On 8 November 1576 she was tried at the High Court, accused of sorcery, witchcraft and incantation, dealing with charms, and abusing the people with devilish craft of sorcery. During the trial, Bessie confessed to meeting with a mysterious man called Thomas Reid, who told her that he had died at the Battle of Pinkie. Thomas appears to have been a type of 'spirit guide' instructing Bessie in curing illnesses and recovering stolen property. She was invited by Thomas to deny her religion and to enter the fairy realm, however, she refused to do so.
                        Despite this refusal, and although Bessie had caused no harm to her neighbours, the court found her guilty and she was sentenced to be executed. It is likely that she would have been strangled before her dead body was burned, as very few witches were burned alive.
                        Bessie was only one of 3,837 people known to have faced a formal accusation of witchcraft in Scotland. Of the confirmed cases, around 160 involved people from Ayrshire.
