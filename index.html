                    <h2><i class="fas fa-hat-wizard"></i> Jonet Slowane <i class="fas fa-hat-wizard"></i></h2>

                    <p>
                        Jonet Slowane was tried for witchcraft in 1658. She had originally been accused in 1651.
                        She was accused of "malificium" (the act of witchcraft performed with the intention of causing damage or injury) She was also said to be demonic (she probably had a fair temper). She certainly cursed frequently and was quarrelsome.
                        This was over 60 years after James VI had used "witch" hunting as a form of propaganda in his bid for the English crown. "Newes from Scotland" highlighted his battle against the forces of "evil". Surely a man of such integrity and zeal would make an excellent monarch in London!
                        Unfortunately, for poorer folk, there remained the Rev William Adair in Ayr, a man involved in 15 of the 30 trials in the town. Jonet Slowane was one of the last to be tried in the town. Few nobles were ever accused in Scotland and if they were it was probably due to a political motive from the noble (or Royal) born accuser.
                        14 men and 10 women testified against Jonet, tragically one of the accusers was her daughter.
                        She was tried at the Tollbooth in 1659. During her year's incarceration she was found to have the devil's mark on her; this would have involved being stabbed by a 3 inch pin frequently to find an area that didn't discolour when pricked. Torture was perfectly legal for "witch" trials and she would have been deprived of sleep for days which would induce sufficient delirium to implicate others in witchcraft when prompted.
                        She was convicted and sentenced to be strangled and burned. This would have been carried out at the Malt Cross.
                        The reality, this was all probably part of a property dispute.

                    <hr>
                    <p>
                        On 8 November 1576 she was tried at the High Court, accused of sorcery, witchcraft and incantation, dealing with charms, and abusing the people with devilish craft of sorcery. During the trial, Bessie confessed to meeting with a mysterious man called Thomas Reid, who told her that he had died at the Battle of Pinkie. Thomas appears to have been a type of 'spirit guide' instructing Bessie in curing illnesses and recovering stolen property. She was invited by Thomas to deny her religion and to enter the fairy realm, however, she refused to do so.
                        Despite this refusal, and although Bessie had caused no harm to her neighbours, the court found her guilty and she was sentenced to be executed. It is likely that she would have been strangled before her dead body was burned, as very few witches were burned alive.
                        Bessie was only one of 3,837 people known to have faced a formal accusation of witchcraft in Scotland. Of the confirmed cases, around 160 involved people from Ayrshire.

                <h2> <i class="fas fa-hand-sparkles"></i> Margaret Barclay <i class="fas fa-hand-sparkles"></i> </h2>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    She was strangled and burned at the stake (as was another woman convicted in the same case, Isabel Crawford, just outside the old burgh boundary at Springfield, near Townhead / Mill Road corner, close to where Malcolm Gardens is today).
                    It has said that the Irvine witches were burned at a spot beyond the Townhead, near Springfield. Witches were certainly associated with this locality, because nearby at Patons Thorn, 
                    the devil in the shape of a black foal is reputed to have appeared to Margaret Barclay and her associates.
                    The Trial of Margaret Barclay resulted in the agonising deaths of Isobel Inch, an elderly woman, vagrant John Stewart, beautiful young mother Margaret Barclay and Isobel Crawford who was in the full bloom of youth.
                    They were accused of being involved in a satanic plot that was widely believed to have caused the Irvine vessel The Gift of God to be wrecked off the coast of Cornwall, 
                    causing most of the local crew, including Provost Andrew Tran to perish.
                    It was as a consequence of this that the Justice Court comprising of ministers and magistrates, included the new Provost, John Peebles, was commissioned.
                    Isobel Inch was the first of the alleged coven to perish as a result of the brutal treatment meted out to her by her accusers. She endured several days 
                    of pitiless interrogation before succumbing and promising to make a good formal confession the next day.
                    The same night in desperation she flung herself from the belfry of the Old Kirk where she had been imprisoned.
                    Although critically ill from her fall, she was still pressed to admit her part in the demonic scheme. She died from her injuries five days later maintaining her innocence to the last minute of her life.
                    John Stewart, an itinerant juggler, likewise resorted to desperate measures to relieve his sufferings.
                    Incarcerated in the Tolbooth, he was so securely fettered that he pleaded with the Rev David Dickson, minister of Irvine, who attended him during the trial, 
                    that "I am so strictly guarded that it lies not in my power to get my hand to take off my bonnet, nor to get bread to my mouth."
                    Later, being left unattended with his shackles loosened, he seized the moment and committed suicide by strangling himself with a piece of hemp used to tie his bonnet.
                    Margaret Barclay was a spirited, high tempered, young woman who steadfastly denied all the 'devilish practices' made against her.
                    The most incriminating evidence the Justice Court had against her was that she carried a piece of rowan tree and a colour thread, to make, as she said her cow to give milk when it failed.
                    To overcome her resolve the inquiry proposed a method of 'gentle torture' as this would take into account her age and sex.
                    This tender torment consisted of placing Margaret's legs in the stocks and loading her bare shins with iron bars until she acknowledged her guilt, 
                    the weights were removed only when she promised the inquisition that she would tell them what they wanted to hear.
                    On her last day in court she implored, "All I have confessed was in agony of torture , and before God, all I have spoken is false and untrue."
                    After sentence was passed she was immediately taken to a place of execution outside the old burgh boundary known as Springfield (just about where Malcolm Gardens is today).
                    Having made many expressions of religion and repentance, this poor soul met the fate of most convicted witches in Scotland by being strangled at the stake, then having her body burned to ashes.
                    Three innocent lives lost by barely credible allegations, the magistrates sought a fourth.
                    After the Rev. David Dickson failed with earnest prayers to open the 'obdurate and closed heart' of Isobel Crawford, she also was introduced to the 'gentle torture'.
                    t is recorded that Isobel endured her torment with unbelievable firmness, suffering in silence, with above thirty stone of iron laid on her legs. Only when the bars were moved to other parts of her legs 
                    she relented with cries of 'tak of, tak of, and I shall tell all".
                    After her confession, she then experienced the same cruel end Margaret Barclay suffered.
                    However, at her judicial killing, she absolutely rejected the consolations of religion, and raged at the great injustice by constantly interrupting the minister in his prayers and totally refusing to pardon the executioner, 
                    as was the custom. Fastened to the stake, this blameless girl died a bewildered maniac.

                <h2><i class="fas fa-cat"></i> Maggie Osborne <i class="fas fa-cat"></i></h2>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    Many tales concerning one particular practitioner of the black arts, Maggie Osborne, were in circulation in Ayr in the early part of the nineteenth century. In due course they came to be set down in print, both in poetry and prose. 
                    No woman of this name can be found in the surviving records dealing with prosecutions for witchcraft, although there are large gaps in these records for the period in which she is said to have lived. 
                    The legends tell how Maggie came to bear a grudge against a particular family, and caused their house to be engulfed by snow. The only survivor was a sailor who happened to be away at sea, so a storm was conjured up 
                    which sank his ship with all hands. Maggie soon began to suspect that her maid had discovered her secret. One night, while the maid was brewing beer (Maggie kept an inn) a gang of ferocious cats invaded the outhouse and threw themselves at her, 
                    trying to tumble her into the boiling vat. Grabbing a ladle, the girl splashed the steaming liquid over her assailants, giving special attention to their leader. Next day, Maggie (who was an adept shape-shifter) stayed in her bed, 
                    and it turned out that she had been badly scalded. The maid told all she knew to the town’s minister, William Adair, and Maggie was tried, convicted, and sentenced to be burned at the Malt Cross.
