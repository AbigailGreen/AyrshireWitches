                <p>
                    Jonet Slowane was tried for witchcraft in 1658. She had originally been accused in 1651.
                    She was accused of malificium, magical acts intended to cause harm or death to people or property.
                    She was also said to be demonic as she had a temper, cursed and argued.
                    Jonet was one of the last to be tried in the town of Ayr. 14 men and 10 women testified against
                    Jonet, tragically one of the accusers was her daughter.
                    She was tried at the Tollbooth in 1659. During her year imprisoned she was discovered to have the
                    devil's mark. This would have involved her being pierced repeatedly with a 3 inch pin
                    to identify an area that didn't discolour when poked. During witch trials, torture was entirely
                    legal
                    and she would have been deprived of sleep for days causing her to become delirious enough
                    when provoked to implicate others in witchcraft. She was convicted and sentenced to death by
                    strangulation then burning. This would have been carried out at the Malt Cross.
                    Tragically, in reality, this was almost certainly part of a property dispute.

                <h2><i class="fas fa-broom"></i>Bessie Dunlop <i class="fas fa-broom"></i></h2>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    Bessie Dunlop was charged with sorcery, witchcraft, and incantation, trading with charms,
                    and exploiting the people with diabolical magic on November 8, 1576, at the High Court in Ayr.
                    She had been a healer and midwife, relying on old superstitions, traditional folk medicine and
                    charms
                    for helping people. During the trial, Bessie admitted to seeing the spectre of a man named Thomas
                    Reid,
                    who informed her he had died in the Battle of Pinkie. Thomas appears to have served as a kind
                    of'spirit guide'
                    coaching Bessie on how to heal ailments and restore stolen items. Thomas asked her to abandon her
                    religion and
                    enter the land of the fairies, but she declined. Despite her refusal, and despite the fact that
                    Bessie
                    had done no harm to her neighbours, the court judged her guilty and sentenced her to death.
                    Bessie is known as "The Witch O'Dalry", Dalry being a small in Ayrshire. A group of women from the
                    town hope
                    to install a permanent art piece next to the A737 in honour of Bessie. She was only one of 3,837
                    people
                    known to have faced a formal accusation of witchcraft in Scotland. Around 160 cases involved people
                    from Ayrshire.

                <h2> <i class="fas fa-hand-sparkles"></i> Margaret Barclay <i class="fas fa-hand-sparkles"></i> </h2>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    Margaret Barclay was strangled and burned at the stake just outside the old burgh boundary,close to
                    where Malcolm Gardens is today in Irvine, in 1618. Her trial resulted in the agonising deaths of
                    herself and three others. They were accused of being involved in a satanic plot that was widely
                    believed to have caused the Irvine vessel The Gift of God to be wrecked off the coast of Cornwall,
                    causing most of the local crew, including Provost Andrew Tran to perish. Margaret was a spirited,
                    high tempered, young woman who firmly denied denied the witchcraft allegations made against her.
                    The most incriminating evidence the Justice Court had against her was that she carried a piece of
                    rowan tree and a colour thread, to make, as she said, her cow to give milk when it failed.
                    To overcome her resolve the inquiry proposed a method of 'gentle torture' as this would take into
                    account her age and sex. This tender torment consisted of placing Margaret's legs in the stocks
                    and loading her bare shins with iron bars until she acknowledged her guilt- the weights were removed
                    only when she promised the inquisition that she would tell them what they wanted to hear.
                    On her last day in court she implored, "All I have confessed was in agony of torture , and before
                    God, all I have spoken is false and untrue". After sentence was passed she was immediately taken
                    to a place of execution. Having made many expressions of religion and repentance, this poor soul
                    met the fate of most convicted witches in Scotland by being strangled at the stake, then having
                    her body reduced to ashes.

                <h2><i class="fas fa-cat"></i> Maggie Osborne <i class="fas fa-cat"></i></h2>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    Around the early nineteenth century, several stories about Maggie Osborne, a black arts
                    practitioner,
                    circulated in Ayr. They were eventually set down in print, both poetically and in prose.
                    There is no trace of a woman with this name in the surviving records of prosecutions for
                    witchcraft, although there are major gaps in the documents for the period in which she is said to
                    have lived. According to legend Maggie came to harboured a grudge against a certain family, and
                    caused their
                    deaths by making snow envelope their house. The only survivor was a sailor who was at sea at the
                    time,
                    so Maggie was said to have conjured a storm which sank his ship with all hands.
                    Maggie became suspicious that her maid had discovered her secret.
                    Whilst the maid was brewing beer one evening at the Inn Maggie ran, a vicious group of cats
                    entered the outhouse and attacked her, trying to make her fall headlong into the boiling vat.
                    Grabbing a ladle, the girl splashed the steaming liquid over the cats, giving special attention to
                    their leader.
                    The following day, Maggie - reportedly a skilled shape-shfter- stayed in her bed.
                    She was found to have been severlely scalded. Maggie was tried, condemned, and sentenced to be
                    burned at
                    the Malt Cross after the maid told the town's minister, William Adair, everything that she knew.
                    A cross of paving stones exists today in Ayr, in the roadway at the junction of High Street and New
                    Bridge Street,
                    marking the of the Malt Cross.

                    Accused of being in a coven along with Margaret Barclay, Isabel Crawford, and John Stewart in 1618,
                    she was the first of the group to die as a consequence of the torture inflicted upon her by her
                    accusers.
                    She endured several days of horrid interrogation before finally relenting and making a promise to
                    formally
                    confess the following day. However, she attempted suicide by jumping out of her jail cell, which was
                    at the
                    top of the Old Kirk belfry, during the night. Having fallen from a great height, she was severly
                    injured.
                    Despite this, the questioning and pressure to admit guilt continued. Five days later she would
                    succumb to her injuries and die. She never admitted any guilt or being part of a malevolent scheme,
                    and maintained her innocence until her dying breath. The aforementioned John Stewart, an itinerant
                    juggler,
                    also attempted to kill himself prior to his trial whilst incarcerated in the Tolbooth. He convinced
                    the
                    Rev David Dickson, minister of Irvine, who attended him during the trial, that he was so securely
                    tied up that
                    he could not remove his bonnet nor feed himslf. His shackles were loosened and he managed to
                    strangle himself
                    with a piece of hemp used to tie his bonnet.

                    Another member of the so-called coven in Irvine, which also included Margaret Barclay and Isobel
                    Inch,
                    Isabel Crawford was described as being a woman in the 'full bloom of youth'. Sir Walter Scott wrote
                    about
                    The Irvine Witch Trial 200 years after the fact. Co-accused of harvesting a plot to capsize a ship
                    causing
                    the drowning of most of the crew, Isabel was tried and found guilty. Undergoing the same 'gentle
                    torture'
                    of iron bars piled onto her shins as meted out to Margaret Barclay. Isabel was said to be strong
                    willed though,
                    and managed to suffer through over thirty pounds of iron crushing her legs without uttering a word
                    in pain.
                    She finally gave in to the punishment when her torturers moved the iron bars to different placements
                    on her legs.
                    Only at that point did she agree to confess. She was strangled and burned. Her strong spirit
                    continued until her
                    last moments however. She raged and interuppted the minister, who was reciting prayers whilst
                    overseeing
                    her execution. Also, it was customary for the witch to pardon the executioner- Isabel would do no
                    such thing
                    and pont blank refused.
