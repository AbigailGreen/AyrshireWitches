Witches of Ayrshire is an informative website. It aims to provide the visitor with interesting information regarding the subject matter of witches and witch trials in the region of Ayrshire, Scotland. 
There is a page with a timeline of historical events, as well as a page with general facts about the subject of witchcraft.


## **User Experience (UX)**



## Design


The design is simplistic in style, with a main header image consistent on each page.
The footer is also consistent across each page, providing simple icons for links.
On each page is an easy to use navigation bar, which clearly identifies where each link will take you to on the website.

## Colour Scheme

To choose a colour scheme, the [ColorSpace](https://mycolor.space/) webiste was used.
The colour orange was chosen initially as it suits the theme of witches, has connetations of Halloween, pumpkins, autumn, and is often utilised in witch costumes and decor. 
The ColorSpace website then generated colour palettes- the Switch palette based on #D95E05 colour was chosen. This provided four complimentary colours to incorpote in the site, which provides a pleasant visual experience for viewers. 

## Typography

The Merriweather font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Merriweather is an elegant font, this serif font suits the time period being discussed in the site content, it is ideal to use for responsive design as is designed for optimal readability on screens.

Spectral is the font used for title and headings, it is elegant and looks good in headings and is also good for responsivity.

## Imagery

The main image at the top of each page is designed to convey the subject matter, without being overpowering or detracting from site content. The colours fit the overall site colour palette. It has a classic timeless feel and matches the theme of the site. https://unsplash.com/photos/pMKm9pybnTE

Smaller images were used on the homepage and the factoids page which fit into the aesthetic of the site and were relevant to the subject matter. They provide a pleasant visual experience.

Font awesome icons relevant to the subject matter were used to add visual appeal.

# Testing

The W3C Markup Validator and W3C CSS Validator Services were used to validate every page of the project to ensure there were no syntax errors in the project.

W3C Markup Validator - Results
1. [Homepage](validation-results/index.html-validationresults.PNG)
2. [Timeline](validation-results/timeline-validationresults.PNG)
3. [Factoids](validation-results/factoids-validationresults.PNG)

The index.html validation results returned a warning, indicating that the map section does not have a heading. This is a warning, not an error, so the code was not adjusted.

No errors or warnings were returned from timeline.html validation.

No errors or warnings were returned from factoids.html validation.
