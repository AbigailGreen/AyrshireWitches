                <h2>1944</h2>
                <p>Helen Duncan, known as Hellish Nell, from Callendar is the last person jailed under the Witchcraft Act. She developed mysterious powers during the First World War, when she correctly predicted the guise of the soldier she would marry. 
                    Having refined these powers she became increasingly celebrated following her own near death from pneumonia when she was informed of her vocation by a shadowy white. 
                    Helen appeared to be able to tell relatives of the deaths of their loved ones during World War 2, before offical announcements had been made. Even Winston Churchill became interested in her. She served her sentence for the duration of the war.

                <p>Janet Horne. an old woman from Dornoch was tried and burned. There is a monument to her at The Witch's Stone in Littletown, Dornoch. She was the last person to be legally executed for practicing witchcraft in United Kingdom.</p>

                  <p>In Paisley, Catherine Campbell, Agnes Naismith, Margaret Lang, Margaret Fulton, John Reid, John Lindsay (age 11) and James Lindsay (age 14) were all tried for witchcraft and garroted on Gallow Green- with the exception of John Reid 
                      who hung himself before sentencing.
                    All seven bodies were then burned, and the ashes buried at Maxwellton Cross

                  <p>Jonet Slowane was tried at the Tollbooth, and convicted to strangle and burn at the Malt Cross. During her year's incarceration she was found to have the devil's mark on her; this would have involved being stabbed by a 3 inch pin 
                      frequently to find an area that didn't discolour when pricked. Torture was perfectly legal for "witch" trials and she would have been deprived of sleep for days which would induce sufficient delirium to implicate others in witchcraft

                  <h2>1653</h2>
                  <p>The Kirk Session appointed a committee to enquire into several cases of witchcraft  and prepare evidence for the Presbytery. The names of the witches are not recorded, but very probably Maggie Osborne was one of them. 
                      It is commonly asserted that she was the last witch executed in Scotland, but this is not the case. The last was an old woman of Dornoch, who was burned in 1722 as indicated in this timeline.</p>

                    The Gallows Knowe, on a grassy knoll south of the Robert Burns Memorial in Irvine, was the scene of many hangings and burnings.
