            <p>Despite wedding vows, it was fairly normal practice for </p>
            <p>women accused of witchcraft to face trial under their maiden name, </p>
            <p>rather then their married surname. It is possible that this was to </p>
            <p>protect their husbands from the stigma of association with </p>
            <p>such develish deeds. This may in part explain why it is so difficult </p>
            <p>to locate formal records of Maggie Osbornes witchcraft trial.</p>

            <h2><i class="fas fa-history"></i> The First Witch <i class="fas fa-history"></i></h2>
            <p>It’s unclear exactly when witches came on the historical scene,</p>
            <p>but one of the earliest records of a witch is in the Bible</p>
            <p>in the book of 1 Samuel, thought be written between 931 B.C. and 721 B.C.</p>
            <p>It tells the story of when King Saul sought the Witch of Endor to summon</p>
            <p>the dead prophet Samuel’s spirit to help him defeat the Philistine army.</p>
            <p>The witch roused Samuel, who then prophesied the death of Saul and his sons.</p>
            <p> The next day, according to the Bible,</p>
            <p> Saul’s sons died in battle, and Saul committed suicide.</p>

            <h2><i class="fas fa-hat-wizard"></i> Wizardry <i class="fas fa-hat-wizard"></i></h2>
            <p>Although the majority of people accused of witchcraft </p>
            <p>were female, men were not exempt. Across Europe in the   </p>
            <p>years of witch persecution around 6000 men</p>
            <p>10-15% of the total – were executed for witchcraft.</p>
            <p>In Scotland, records reveal 468 cases of accused men,</p>
            <p>an example being Alexander Drummond.</p>
            <p>He had been a healer for 50 years and a campaign to clear his name </p>
            <p>had a lot of support. Despite this, he was tried, strangled and burned in 1629.</p>

            <p>Witchcraft did not die out with the last of the executions.</p>
            <p>Witchcraft, wicca, white witches- they are all present today.</p>
            <p>Crystals, spells and curses are very much part of current society,</p>
            <p>venture onto TikTok or any social media platform</p>
            <p>and you will find many current practicers of the witchy arts.</p>
            <p>Anyone who believes they have witches in their ancestry</p>
            <p>or simply is attracted to the otherworldly aspects of the craft</p>
            <p>can certainly find inspiration and teachings online.</p>
            <p>From being a feared accusation centuries past, it has evolved into</p>
            <p>a fullfilling alternativelifestyle for some,</p>
            <p>not to mention a profitable business venture for others</p>

            <h2><i class="fas fa-video"></i> Witches in Media <i class="fas fa-video"></i></h2>
            <p>Witches have featured in fairy tales and fiction for centuries.</p>
            <p>In her earliest incarnations, the witch served as a warning.</p>
            <p>Stories about the witch-as-hag demonised and punished women for</p>
            <p>attempting to exert power outside the bounds of the domestic sphere.</p>
            <p>Beyond the fairy tale, women with occult knowledge or simply poor,</p>
            <p>were the victims of persecution and prosecution in 16th and 17th-century Britain.</p>
            <p>Nowadays, though, the witch is often praised as a feminist figure , who pushes boundaries,</p>
            <p> breaks the rules and punishes patriarchal authority.</p>
            <p> Buffy the Vampire Slayer’s Willow Rosenberg and Disney’s Maleficant</p>
            <p>are two oft-cited examples of the feminist witch.</p>
            <p>Other examples of popular witches in modern day theatre include</p>
            <p> Hannah Abbott from the popular Harry Potter franchise</p>
            <p>and Agnes and Aja of The Vampire Diaries fame.</p>

            <h2><i class="fas fa-water"></i> Sink or Swim? <i class="fas fa-water"></i></h2>
            <p>In the river near Irvine</p>
            <p>was a deep pool known as</p>
            <p>the Witches Plumb where witches were</p>
            <p>ducked to test if the devil would save them from drowning</p>
            <p>This swimming test was conducted all over, the accused were</p>
            <p>stripped to their undergarments, bound and  </p>
            <p>tossed in the water to to see if they would sink or float.</p>
            <p>Since witches were believed to have spurned the sacrament of baptism,</p>
            <p>it was thought that the water would reject their body and prevent them from submerging.</p>
            <p>According to this logic, an innocent person would sink like a stone,</p>
            <p>but a witch would simply bob on the surface. The victim typically had a rope tied around their waist</p>
            <p>so they could be pulled from the water if they sank,</p>            
            <p>but it was common for accidental drowning deaths to occur.</p>

            <h2><i class="far fa-hand-paper"></i> The Devils Mark <i class="far fa-hand-paper"></i></h2>
            <p>Witch-hunters often had their suspects stripped and publically</p>
            <p>examined for signs of an unsightly blemish that witches</p>
            <p>were said to receive upon making their pact with Satan.</p>
            <p>This “Devil’s Mark” could supposedly change shape and color,</p>
            <p>and was believed to be numb and insensitive to pain.</p>
            <p>Prosecutors might also search for the “witches’ teat,”</p>
            <p> an extra nipple allegedly used to suckle the witch’s helper animals.</p>
            <p>In both cases, it was easy for even the most minor physical imperfections</p>
            <p>to be labeled as the work of the devil himself.</p>

            <h2><i class="fas fa-birthday-cake"></i> Let Them Eat Cake <i class="fas fa-birthday-cake"></i></h2>
            <p>A bizarre form of counter-magic, </p>
            <p>the witch cake was a supernatural dessert</p>
            <p> used to identify suspected evildoers.</p> 
            <p>In cases of mysterious illness or possession,</p>
            <p>witch-hunters would take asample of the victim’s urine,</p> 
            <p>mix it with rye-meal and ashes and bake it into a cake.</p>
            <p>This stomach-turning concoction was then fed to a dog</p> 
            <p>—the “familiars,” or animal helpers of witches,</p>
            <p>—in the hope that the beast would fall under its spell</p> 
            <p>and reveal the name of the guilty sorcerer</p>
