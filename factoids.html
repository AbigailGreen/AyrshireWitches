            <h2><i class="fas fa-church"></i> For Better or Worse <i class="fas fa-church"></i></h2>
            <p>Despite wedding vows, it was fairly normal practice for
                women accused of witchcraft to face trial under their maiden name,
                rather then their married surname. It is possible that this was to
                protect their husbands from the stigma of association with
                such develish deeds. This may in part explain why it is so difficult
                to locate formal records of Maggie Osbornes witchcraft trial.</p>

            <h2><i class="fas fa-history"></i> The First Witch <i class="fas fa-history"></i></h2>
            <p>It’s unclear exactly when witches came on the historical scene,
                but one of the earliest records of a witch is in the Bibl
                in the book of 1 Samuel, thought be written between 931 B.C. and 721 B.C.
                It tells the story of when King Saul sought the Witch of Endor to summon
                the dead prophet Samuel’s spirit to help him defeat the Philistine army.
                The witch roused Samuel, who then prophesied the death of Saul and his sons.
                The next day, according to the Bible,
                Saul’s sons died in battle, and Saul committed suicide.</p>

            <h2><i class="fas fa-hat-wizard"></i> Wizardry <i class="fas fa-hat-wizard"></i></h2>
            <p>Although the majority of people accused of witchcraft
                were female, men were not exempt. Across Europe in the
                years of witch persecution around 6000 men
                10-15% of the total – were executed for witchcraft.
                In Scotland, records reveal 468 cases of accused men,
                an example being Alexander Drummond.
                He had been a healer for 50 years and a campaign to clear his name
                had a lot of support. Despite this, he was tried, strangled and burned in 1629.</p>

            <p>At Paton Thorn in Irvine the devil in the form of a black foal is said to have
                appeared to Margaret Barclay and her covenly crew. Horses are associated with many superstitions-
                The Hungarians and Spanish think black horses are lucky – the French and Bedoin believe the reverse.
                Black cats are associated with bad luck in many cultures. In Christian faith, Satan is commonly
                depicted as goat, or creature with cloven hooves.</p>

            <p>Witchcraft did not die out with the last of the executions.
                Witchcraft, wicca, white witches- they are all present today.
                Crystals, spells and curses are very much part of current society,
                venture onto TikTok or any social media platform
                and you will find many current practicers of the witchy arts.
                Anyone who believes they have witches in their ancestry
                or simply is attracted to the otherworldly aspects of the craft
                can certainly find inspiration and teachings online.
                From being a feared accusation centuries past, it has evolved into
                a fullfilling alternativelifestyle for some,
                not to mention a profitable business venture for others.</p>

            <h2><i class="fas fa-video"></i> Witches in Media <i class="fas fa-video"></i></h2>
            <p>Witches have featured in fairy tales and fiction for centuries.
                In her earliest incarnations, the witch stories of old hags served warnings.
                These tales demonised and punished women for
                attempting to exert power outside the bounds of the domestic sphere.
                Beyond the fairy tale, women with occult knowledge or simply poor,
                were the victims of persecution and prosecution in 16th and 17th-century Britain.
                Nowadays, though, the witch is often praised as a feminist figure , who pushes boundaries,
                breaks the rules and punishes patriarchal authority.
                Buffy the Vampire Slayer’s Willow Rosenberg and Disney’s Maleficant
                are two oft-cited examples of the feminist witch.
                Other examples of popular witches in modern day theatre include
                Hannah Abbott from the popular Harry Potter franchise
                and Agnes and Aja of The Vampire Diaries fame.</p>

            <h2><i class="fas fa-water"></i> Sink or Swim? <i class="fas fa-water"></i></h2>
            <p>In the river near Irvine was a deep pool known as the Witches Plumb where witches were
                ducked to test if the devil would save them from drowning. This swimming test
                was conducted all over, the accused were stripped, bound and
                tossed in the water to to see if they would sink or float. Since witches were believed to
                have spurned the sacrament of baptism, it was thought that the water would reject their body
                and prevent them from submerging. According to this logic, an innocent person would sink like a stone,
                but a witch would simply bob on the surface. The victim typically had a rope tied around their waist
                so they could be pulled from the water if they sank, but it was common for accidental drowning deaths to
                occur</p>

            <h2><i class="far fa-hand-paper"></i> The Devils Mark <i class="far fa-hand-paper"></i></h2>
            <p>Witch-hunters often had their suspects stripped and publically
                examined for signs of an unsightly blemish that witches
                were said to receive upon making their pact with Satan.
                This “Devil’s Mark” could supposedly change shape and color,
                and was believed to be numb and insensitive to pain.
                Prosecutors might also search for the “witches’ teat,”
                an extra nipple allegedly used to suckle the witch’s helper animals.
                In both cases, it was easy for even the most minor physical imperfections
                to be labeled as the work of the devil himself.</p>

        <div>
            <h2><i class="fas fa-birthday-cake"></i> Let Them Eat Cake <i class="fas fa-birthday-cake"></i></h2>
            <p>A bizarre form of counter-magic,
                the witch cake was a supernatural dessert
                used to identify suspected evildoers.
                In cases of mysterious illness or possession,
                witch-hunters would take asample of the victim’s urine,
                mix it with rye-meal and ashes and bake it into a cake.
                This stomach-turning concoction was then fed to a dog
                —the “familiars,” or animal helpers of witches,
                —in the hope that the beast would fall under its spell
                and reveal the name of the guilty sorcerer</p>
